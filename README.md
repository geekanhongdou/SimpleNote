# SimpleNote

A (nearly) perfect replica of the original Microsoft Office OneNote on Android.  

Almost implements all features that original OneNote offers:  

 - Section Group, Section and Records of any number

 - Hierarchy amongst Section Groups and Sections via Directories/Files, just like the original version
	
 - Customized Order of any Section Groups/Sections and Records

 - Customized Hierarchy and Folding of any Records (not completed)

 - No Live Account and License required

 - But the data structure is Completely Different with the Original OneNote .one data structure

Plenty of bugs exists, and i'll NOT try to fix it at this time. Anyway This piece of codes' nothin' but a attempt to finish a goddamned CS cource and implement some (inaccurate) Software Enginnerin' Practice.  

Someday i'll rewrite that crap, fix bugs, add new layouts, and maybe implement Material Design, but obviously not now.
